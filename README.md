# Hedgehog Oscar - Online ML inspired by Vorpal Rabbit

*”A nice, online, stand-alone estimator of logistic regression”*

**Features (planned, at least)**

- Logistic regression through-REST-api (with dynamic learning rate and regularization)

- Anomaly detection and drift detection 

- Model rollbacks, version handling and stop-learning mode

- Classification and probability estimation by repeated testing



## Background and inspirational quotes

### Beloved logistic regression
Logistic regression (sort of invented 1830s) is one of the most used ML tools for classification, with good reason.


> The world is divided into two classes, those who believe the incredible, and those who do the improbable.
>
> **Oscar Wilde**

### Less is more

Stochastic gradient descent (with finesse) might not be optimal but
we can try to do one thing good. The hedgehog will be adaptive to parameter changes, as a consequence.

> A fox knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing
>
> **Old Greek proverb**


### Be (mindfully) simple

Even simple models (like log-reg), done with curiosity, will give insights into a problem. I call on both hedgehogs and foxes to help me now and in the future.

> I meant it as a kind of enjoyable intellectual game, but it was taken seriously. Every classification throws light on something.

> **Isaiah Berlin**
